# Star Wars Character Search App

A simple Star Wars character lookup web application, built by my tutee and I as part of my programming tutoring lessons. The goal of this application was to learn the basics of web design and development by building a cool application that can consume an open source API and allow users to search for their favorite star wars characters.
